1. In a bus topology, a break in the fiber can affect all connected ONUs. True. 
2. A tree topology has a single point of failure at the root (OLT). True.  
If the OLT fails, all connected ONUs lose service. 
3. In a ring topology, the signal travels in a straight line. False. 
 In a ring topology, the signal travels in a circular fashion. 
4. All PON topologies require active devices at each ONU. False. 
 PONs use passive splitters, so there are no active devices between the OLT and the ONUs in the optical 
distribution network.
